### Objective: Rethinking Technical Documentation and Training

In order to leverage the Power Platform and SharePoint, this process is designed to help our team collaborate on knowledge capture, while developing some training materials that can be consumed without prior knowledge. This workflow is designed to utilize Microsoft 365 microservices across SharePoint and the Power Platform to improve IT training, documentation, and support services. Specifically, we have 2-3 dozen software applications in engineering that are not available in our Citrix virtual environment. This consumes significant resources and time answering questions on software installations, which are not quickly/aptly answered by long-form technical documents with a series of screenshots. 

This process also lends itself to a new way of thinking about documentation, realizing that it is more efficient to identify and document the frictions in an installation. Most software applications have straightforward installations, but there are also some with a few friction points that can be easily explained in a sentence or two. This format of presenting the information reduces the need to continue (re)writing documentation with screenshots on every version release. Further, a built-in feedback mechanism is critical to its continued modification and maintenance, especially where those performing the work are included in the loop.

>#### Use Case
> 
> Creating a system for software knowledge capture and team collaboration, making training information interactive and easily accessible, while improving user engagement/feedback on processes. 
> 
> #### Components/microservices/products
> 
> SharePoint Pages, Power BI Desktop, Power Automate, Adaptive Cards, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Forms
> 
> #### Key Requirements
> 
> 1. Sound knowledge management and capture: Publishing/editing/collaborating on data in an a central place (Microsoft Lists).
> 2. Interactive data: Transforming/presenting the data to allow easy lookup via dashboards (Power BI Desktop; Power Query Editor).
> 3. Ease-of-access/improved engagement/better UX: Publishing the report in a place where it can both be easily modified on the backend, and easily accessed on the front end. Further, using a UI that allows for engagement and clean notifications (Microsoft Lists; Microsoft Teams; Adaptive Cards).
> 4. Automatically refresh the report when data is changed and inform team members in digital workspaces (Power Automate; Microsoft Teams).
> 5. Built-in feedback loop: Others can provide input on the training data (Microsoft Forms; SharePoint Pages)

#### Microsoft 365 Licensing - Power Platform

>[!question] 
> 1. Does our site license include Power Pages? Does that include Microsoft Teams-site level tenants which can be turned on? If paid only, what is the cost structure under our licensing agreement?
> 2. Unlike with Power Apps, Power Automate appears to have a tenant turned on for our SharePoint site. Could this be done for Power Apps as well under our licensure? 
> 3. Does our site license include Premium options for Power BI workspaces? Does it include the option to turn on Dataverse for model-driven Power Apps? What are the cost structures?
> 4. If a department wanted to purchase Solution-aware Flow(s) (Power Automate), what are the cost structures under our licensing agreement (if any)?
